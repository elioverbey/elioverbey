<article class="post-content">
  <p>With Inbound.org quickly becoming a go-to for Internet Marketing, analyzing the top performing posts on Inbound will give you an understanding of what is performing well in the industry.</p>

<p>Over the year, there have been hundreds of thousands of submissions to Inbound.org. Have you ever wondered what causes a post to do well on Inbound.org? Or what qualities are needed to make a piece sharable in general? What follows is an analysis of the top 1300 submissions to Inbound.org during 2014; from this data, a number of factors have emerged as determinants for the success of an article, including the timing of the post, length, subject, and engagement.</p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>The data in the analysis is drawn from the Top All-Time Posts from Inbound.org. I downloaded over 3,000 URLs in the analysis.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3276" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/all-time-inbound.png" alt="all-time-inbound" width="1151" height="747" srcset="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/all-time-inbound.png 1151w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/all-time-inbound-300x195.png 300w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/all-time-inbound-1024x665.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1151px) 100vw, 1151px" /></p>

<p>After downloading the data, I removed all entries from previous years. Additionally, I removed all entries that had less than 30 ^ up votes. (30 was a reasonable number, as many of the posts began to clutter below 29 up votes.)</p>

<p><strong>In all, I was left with 1,300 entires that were created in 2014 and that had 30 or more upvotes.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Inbound-Data.xls"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3277 size-full" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-10.28.17-PM.png" alt="Data from Analyzing Inboundorg" width="1130" height="615" /></a></p>

<p>If you would like access to the data for your own analysis, <a href="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Inbound-Data.xls">you can download it here</a>. Below are my findings from the data. <em>(*Data was collected on December 27th, 2014. There may be a few last minute 2014 submissions that are not on the list).</em></p>

<h3 id="the-best-day-to-submit-is-monday">The Best Day to Submit is Monday</h3>

<p>Out of the 1300 Top Submissions to Inbound.org, 283 posts (21.77%) were submitted on a Monday. Those posts generally did well because they could ride the momentum of visitors throughout the week. Although Thursday posts saw a spike as well (20.92%), those posts lost momentum going into the weekend.</p>

<p><a href="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-9.25.47-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3279" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-9.25.47-PM.png" alt="inbound post day of week" width="1168" height="565" /></a></p>

<p>As you can see from the graph above, Monday and Thursday are the best days for top submissions.</p>

<p><em>Lesson Learned: If you want a post or submission to do well, don’t release it on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. </em></p>

<h3 id="january-will-be-a-greatmonth-to-submit">January Will be a Great Month to Submit</h3>

<p>As you can see from the graph below, the greatest amount of top submissions were posted last January. There was a small spike again in July, but then the numbers drop off. Interestingly enough, Inbound.org’s community size has increased dramatically, but quality submissions have dropped.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3280" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-9.27.47-PM.png" alt="Inbound Top Post by Month" width="1158" height="564" /></p>

<p>There are a multitude of possibilities to explain this, but here are two of the most likely explanations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>January is the best month for quality content. January is when organizations publish lessons learned, 2014 analysis, and  2015 predictions. Content of the articles is both intriguing and important. January is also the month where content producers set resolutions to “make great content,” but then come February, other priorities often set in, and content becomes mediocre once more (been there, done that).</li>
  <li>The other possibility – and the more likely possibility – Inbound.org’s community is over saturated with content. With 50,000+ members submitting posts every minute (perhaps every second), good and bad content alike can drown and disappear in the sheer vastness of articles, and it becomes increasingly difficult to break through the 30 barrier. Although the upvotes do help separate quality content, if your submission doesn’t get any votes in the first hour, you might as well call your piece done. The moderators and admins can promote quality content, but with that volume, they are bound to miss some. (Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/edfryed" target="_blank">@edfryed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dharmesh" target="_blank">@dharmesh</a> have an algorithmic like fix.)</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see from the screenshot below, even on the slower Sunday, submissions (quality or not) just pile on top of one another. Unless you have friends upvoting your article or a moderator flags it as insightful, your submission may get lost in the crowd.</p>

<p><a href="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/inbound-submissions.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3309" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/inbound-submissions.png" alt="inbound submissions" width="893" height="418" srcset="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/inbound-submissions.png 893w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/inbound-submissions-300x140.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px" /></a></p>

<p><em>Lesson learned: If you want your submission to do well, write quality content and then tweet at Inboundorg, Ed, Mary, etc. It may work, it may not. Even now, as I write this post, I have no idea how well it will perform, or if it’ll just get lost in the crowd. </em></p>

<h3 id="if-submitting-an-articlefor-inboundorg-make-the-post-long">If Submitting an Article for Inbound.org: Make the Post Long</h3>

<p>Below are the top 15 Article Submissions of 2014 (Ask Inbound, Discussions, and Tools were all removed). The shortest article about a MajesticSEO clone was 300 words, the longest was 12,300 words (by yours truly), and <em><strong>the average post length was just north of 3,300 words. </strong></em></p>

<p>As you can see from the chart below, many of the top posts were between 2,000 words and 4,000 words (a far cry from the traditional 300-500 words). There were two posts that were at 300 words, but were comedic in nature and had effects of virality.</p>

<p><a href="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-9.56.23-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3281" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-9.56.23-PM.png" alt="Word Count for Inbound Top Posts" width="950" height="509" /></a></p>

<p><em>Lesson Learned: If you want an article to perform well on Inbound, put a lot of time and effort into it. Most of the top performing articles were 3,000 words, or roughly a 10 minute read (this article – research included – took around 8-10 hours). </em></p>

<h3 id="the-top-submissions-are-from-a-small-handful-mostly-moderators-and-admins">The Top Submissions Are from a Small Handful (Mostly Moderators and Admins)</h3>

<p>As you can see below, many of the top submissions come from Moderators or Admins. One could say they do get paid to post (or volunteer), but in reality, they should be posting the most because they are in touch with the industry and audience.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dharmesh (Dharmesh Shah) CTO of HubSpot</li>
  <li>Malikarjunan (Sam Mallikarjunan) Head of eCommerce Marketing at HubSpot <em>*FYI – if you are looking for someone to follow and learn from, you could not pick a smarter or kinder guy. <strong>Also, check out his top submission rate: 15.38% – He knows what quality content is. </strong></em></li>
</ul>

<p>Rounding out the rest of the top 10 are fighto and victorpan, who both work for <a href="http://www.catalystsearchmarketing.com/" target="_blank">Catalyst Search Marketing</a> (and they normally don’t promote their own stuff).</p>

<h3><a href="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-6.37.04-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3282" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-6.37.04-PM.png" alt="Moderators and Admin Inbound" width="654" height="528" /></a></h3>

<p>As you can see from the graph below, many users have less than one top submission. Again, this could be attributed to quality submissions getting lost in content, but it’s more than likely due to lack of submissions. There are many users on inbound with only a handful of submissions (or none).</p>

<p><a href="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-6.38.10-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3284" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-6.38.10-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-27 at 6.38.10 PM" width="1198" height="590" /></a><em>Lesson Learned: Post quality content often. Don’t promote you own content, but do keep the submissions coming. If you want to have submissions do well, keep at it. </em></p>

<h3 id="title-length-is-everything-56-characters-is-average">Title Length is Everything: 56 Characters is Average</h3>

<p>As you can see from the chart below, may of the titles were between 48 and 61 characters. 30% of the top posts fall in the range.</p>

<p><a href="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-9.23.25-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3283" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-9.23.25-PM.png" alt="character length inbound title" width="1128" height="556" /></a></p>

<p>Although Inbound.org doesn’t truncate long titles – the one below is 110 characters, only 1.8% of the top posts had more than 100 characters.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-28-at-11.30.41-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3314" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-28-at-11.30.41-AM.png" alt="Long form title" width="910" height="114" srcset="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-28-at-11.30.41-AM.png 910w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-28-at-11.30.41-AM-300x38.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /></a>Lesson learned: Keep your title succinct.</em></p>

<h4 id="odd-or-even-number-in-posts-no-significance">Odd or Even Number in Posts: No Significance</h4>

<p>On Inbound.org, it’s a myth that articles with odd numbers perform better. 52% of the posts that led with a number (ie, 8 ways to…) contained an even number, while 48% contained an odd number (ie, 7 ways too…).</p>

<p><em>Lesson learned: Even or odd, it doesn’t really matter.</em></p>

<h3 id="top-websites-submitted-moz-dominates-inboundorg-followed-by-slideshare-and-se-land">Top Websites Submitted: Moz Dominates Inbound.org, followed by Slideshare, and SE Land</h3>

<p>Below are the best performing websites in terms of top submissions. As you can see, Moz dominates.</p>

<p>The most promising fact is that although Inbound.org is maintained by HubSpot Labs, HubSpot isn’t pumping and promoting their content throughout. Even the 12 submissions could be attributed to others outside of the organization.</p>

<p>In a future analysis, it would be fascinating to research if any of the Moz community has drifted away from commenting and interacting on Moz.com and now interact on Inbound.org.</p>

<p><em>Lesson Learned: Although the major industry organizations do dominate the top posts, 60% of the other top performing submissions come from smaller websites (like this one.) </em></p>

<h3 id="top-keywords-in-title-marketing-content-and-google-are-top-3">Top Keywords in Title: Marketing, Content, and Google are Top 3</h3>

<p>Successful titles have included: Google, SEO, inbound, content, etc. Generally, the top titles were written without a positive or negative opinion; they were simply statements.</p>

<h4 id="top-categories-seo-content-and-social">Top Categories: SEO, Content, and Social</h4>

<p>The top categories on Inbound.org are shown below.</p>

<p><a href="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-10.52.53-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3291" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-10.52.53-PM.png" alt="top categories inbound" width="413" height="213" srcset="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-10.52.53-PM.png 413w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-10.52.53-PM-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px" /></a></p>

<p><em>Lesson Learned: If you are looking for topics to write about, consider the words and categories above as a starting point. </em></p>

<h3 id="comments-mean-upvotes">Comments Mean Upvotes</h3>

<p>The correlation between comments and upvotes is statistically significant. There were only 7 (less than .5%) instances in which there were more comments than upvotes.</p>

<p><a href="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-11.07.53-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3294" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-11.07.53-PM.png" alt="Comments and Upvotes Inbound" width="1095" height="561" srcset="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-11.07.53-PM.png 1095w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-11.07.53-PM-300x154.png 300w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-27-at-11.07.53-PM-1024x525.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1095px) 100vw, 1095px" /></a></p>

<p><em>Lesson Learned: If you want to have a submission or post do well on Inbound.org, make it interactive. You can do this many ways, but here are 3:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Comment on other submissions and in turn, you’ll build a community in which others are invited to add something to your submission.</li>
  <li>Get your friends and colleagues to comment on your submissions.</li>
  <li>In addition to posting your article, pose questions at the end. Move the commenters (if it is a post) from the blog to inbound.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="if-you-want-a-top-submission-start-a-discussion">If you want a Top Submission, Start a Discussion</h3>

<p>The best submissions on Inbound.org are actually not articles, they are discussions. (Ask me Anything, Ask Inbound, Community, etc). More than 15% of the top submissions on Inbound.org were discussions.</p>

<p><em>Why?</em></p>

<p>Comments and Interactions lead to upvotes.</p>

<p><em>Lesson Learned: Although you may not be driving people back to your site, you can build a quality audience on Inbound.org. Post an article with the intent of creating discussion – that is what Inbound is all about, isn’t it? </em></p>

<p>So, with 2015 just around the corner, keep these lessons from 2014 in mind. Best of luck!</p>
