## Step-by-Step: Building the Office Shed

We started with a dream — a quiet, functional workspace right in our backyard. Here's a breakdown of the build with images from each stage of the process.

### Step 1: Installing Vent Chutes for Roof Ventilation

To allow for proper airflow between insulation and roof decking, we installed baffle vents along the roofline. These were custom-fitted into the vaulted ceiling bays.

### Step 2: Wall Insulation with Rockwool

We used Rockwool for its excellent sound-dampening and fire-resistant properties. Every wall cavity was carefully filled.

### Step 3: Framing and Dry-In Complete

Once insulation was in, we staged materials like trim and interior boards. Our ladder and miter saw helped speed things up.

### Step 4: Solar Panel Installed

The roof-mounted panel provides power for lights and a fan inside the shed. A clean, efficient way to go off-grid.

### Step 5: Construction Crew (and Fun)

This project was a team effort — here’s a proud dad and his son mid-project.

### Step 6: Sunset Views from the Shed

One of the best parts of this shed is the view. Sunsets are a daily reward.

### Step 7: Final Electrical and Trim Prep

The EcoFlow Delta and a space heater helped keep us going. We left outlets accessible and dry-fit the trim boards.

### Step 8: Happy Builders!

Masks off, smiles on — we loved building this together.

### Step 9: Installing the Shiplap

We chose pre-painted white shiplap for a clean, modern look. It instantly brightened the space.

### Step 10: Finishing Details

Here’s a close-up of the finished lower half. Tight seams and flush corners make all the difference.
