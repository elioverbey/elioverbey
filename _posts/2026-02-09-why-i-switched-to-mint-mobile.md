title: "Why I Switched to Mint Mobile (And Why My Parents Did Too)"
meta_description: After a few years on AT&T, I switched my family to Mint Mobile and cut our phone bill. Here's an honest look at the savings, the service, and the one time I noticed a difference.

A friend recommended Mint Mobile to me about a year and a half ago, and it's genuinely been one of the best money moves we've made. I wanted to write this up because word of mouth is how I found out about it, and if this helps you cut your phone bill, it's worth it.

## The AT&T Situation

My wife and I had always gotten our phones through AT&T. It was fine for a while, but then they started doing the thing where they lock in your device credit and you can only apply so much per billing cycle. On top of that, the prices just kept creeping up (at the time).

When I switched jobs and we needed to tighten up our budget, the phone bill was one of the first things we looked at. A friend had been on Mint and recommended it, so we decided to give it a shot.

## The Savings Are Real

Here's where I'll let the numbers do the talking. Below are two screenshots from my YNAB account - one showing what we were paying AT&T, and one showing our Mint Mobile charges.

</figure>

This isn't to say AT&T is a bad carrier - they're not. But on their unlimited plan, we were consistently paying **$135/month** for two lines. You'll notice the $172.66 charge in there - that was because I had to travel to Dublin for work and added AT&T's international plan for the trip. The two $645.51 charges at the end were us paying off our lines so we could leave. Now, to be fair - we didn't actually lose the full $645 per phone. That was the total remaining balance, but we'd already received most of the device value through credits. I went back and looked at our last AT&T bill - we were on payment 8 of 36 at $9.73/month per line. So the real loss was the 28 months of credits we forfeited: about $272 per phone, or roughly **$545 total** for both lines. Still not nothing, but a lot less painful than it looks at first glance.


Now here's what Mint Mobile looks like:

</figure>

**A quick breakdown of the Mint charges**, since they look a little different than a typical monthly bill:

- **$62.98 (Oct 2024)** - This was our trial period to make sure we liked the service before committing.
- **$529.02 (Jan 2025)** - Two lines, 15GB plan, paid for the full year. That's our annual cost for both of us.
- **$65.94 (Jan 2026)** - My wife's 15GB plan renewal. They let you pay quarterly now, which is nice.
- **$126.51 (Jan 2026)** - My renewal, and this one's lower because I had 2 referral credits applied (thanks mom and dad).

So we went from ~$135/month to about $529/year for two lines. 

Here's a chart that shows the full picture - including the upfront device payoff we had to eat to leave AT&T, and when the switch started actually saving us money:

</figure>

Even factoring in the credits we forfeited (~$545), we hit break-even at around 9 months. Everything after that is savings - roughly $97/month compared to what we would've been paying AT&T.

**Here's how I got there:** The real cost to switch was $608 upfront (~$545 in forfeited credits + the $62.98 trial). Then in January we paid $529.02 for two lines for the full year - bringing our total Mint spend to $1,137. If we'd stayed on AT&T at $135/month, we would've hit that same $1,137 by about month 9. After that point, AT&T keeps going at $135/month while our Mint bill stays flat until renewal. That's where the savings really start to compound.

## The Experience

I'm on the 15GB plan, and honestly, it's been more than enough. I work from home and use Wi-Fi most of the day, so your mileage will vary depending on how much you're on mobile data. In a year and a half, I've only come close to running out once. I think I got down to about 1GB remaining. My wife is on Mint too and hasn't had any issues.

</figure>

Mint runs on T-Mobile's network, and I'd say the service is comparable to what we had on AT&T. The **one time** I noticed any kind of degradation was at the NC State football game. From what I've read, MVNOs like Mint Mobile can get deprioritized at large events. It wasn't terrible - my texts with images were just taking longer than usual to send. I was still able to make and receive phone calls without any problems. That's the only time I've noticed anything.

## My Parents Switched Too

I liked Mint enough that I switched my parents over as well. They're on a fixed income, so keeping costs low matters. They got the unlimited plan for the year at $180 with the current promotion. That'll go up to $360 the following year, but they can always switch down to a smaller plan. They love it.

## Would I Recommend It?

If you're looking to lower your phone bill and you're mostly on Wi-Fi during the day, Mint Mobile is worth a serious look. The savings have been meaningful for our family, and the service has been solid.

This isn't a sponsored post - just a genuine recommendation from someone who's been using it for over a year and a half. That said, I do have a referral link, and I wanted to be upfront about that.
