I've been using Claude pretty heavily over the past year - for drafting messages, writing blog posts, pulling together docs, and just generally thinking through problems. It's been great, but there was one thing that kept bugging me: the output never quite sounded like me.

<!--more-->

It would be *close*. Helpful, clear, well-structured. But it had that unmistakable AI tone - slightly too polished, a little too formal, missing the little quirks that make your writing feel like yours. I'd spend almost as much time editing the output as I would've spent writing it from scratch.

So I decided to fix it. I built a personal style guide for Claude.

## Why Bother?

If you're using AI tools once in a while, you probably don't need this. But if you're using them daily - for Slack messages, emails, docs, posts - the compounding cost of editing every output to sound like you adds up fast.

I also realized something: I'd never actually sat down and articulated *how* I communicate. What phrases do I reach for? What tone do I default to? What do I consciously avoid? Building the guide forced me to think about my own voice in a way I never had before. That alone was worth the exercise.

## What I Included

Here's the structure I landed on. I'll share the full guide below, but wanted to walk through the thinking behind each section first.

### Foundational Tone Principles

I started with three principles that define how I communicate at work: **warm professionalism**, **collaborative by default**, and **proactively helpful**. For each one, I included "do" and "don't" examples pulled from actual messages I've sent. The examples matter more than the labels - they give Claude something concrete to anchor on.

### Language Patterns & Vocabulary

This is where it gets specific. I catalogued the sentence starters I naturally use ("Hey team," "Quick update," "Wanted to share..."), the filler phrases that feel like me ("That tracks," "Good call," "Happy to jam on this"), and the transitional phrases I lean on. I also documented how I close messages.

This section probably makes the biggest difference in output quality. It's the difference between Claude generating something that sounds generically professional and something that sounds like it actually came from my keyboard.

### Structural Preferences

How I organize information matters as much as the words I use. I lead with the headline, provide context, include specifics, and end with an action or offer to help. I use bullet points for lists of 3+ items. I bold key callouts. I keep things concise.

I also included length calibration - quick acknowledgments are 1-2 sentences, standard updates are 3-5 sentences, and detailed explanations get structured sections. This keeps Claude from over-writing when a "Got it, thanks!" would do.

### Emoji & Expression Usage

I use emojis, but thoughtfully. 1-2 per message, usually at the end of a sentence. Never substituting for words. I documented which emojis I actually use (thumbs up, celebration, fire, thinking face) and the rules around them. Small detail, but it matters for sounding authentic in Slack.

### Communication by Context

Different situations call for different approaches. I wrote out how I share data (lead with insights, not just numbers), ask questions (show I've already thought about it), give feedback (direct but kind), disagree (focus on the idea, not the person), celebrate wins (genuine and specific), and deliver difficult news (transparent, solution-focused).

### Things I Never Do

Just as important as what I *do* is what I don't. No profanity. No passive aggression. No "per my last email." No corporate speak like "please advise." No excessive hedging. This section acts as a guardrail.

### Platform-Specific Adaptations

I write differently on Slack than I do in email than I do in a doc. Slack is the most casual. Email is a touch more structured. Docs and reports are more formal with headers and sections. Blog posts are personal and transparent. Spelling this out helps Claude adjust based on the context.

## How I Use It

In practice, I keep the style guide as a file in my project and reference it when I'm working with Claude. When I ask it to draft a Slack message or write a blog post, it pulls from the guide and the output is noticeably closer to my actual voice.

Is it perfect? No. I still edit. But I'm editing for content and nuance now, not for tone. That's a meaningful difference when you're writing dozens of messages a day.

## The Full Guide

Here's the complete style guide. If you want to build your own, feel free to use this as a starting point and swap in your own patterns.

### Core Identity

**Role:** Revenue Operations professional
**Communication Context:** Cross-functional collaboration with Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, Data, and Leadership teams

### Foundational Tone Principles

**1. Warm Professionalism**
Strikes a balance between being approachable and maintaining professional credibility. The tone is never stiff or corporate, but always respectful and competent.

- **Do:** "Hey team, I pulled together some data on this - happy to walk through it if helpful!"
- **Don't:** "Please find attached the requested analysis for your review."

**2. Collaborative by Default**
Frame work as a team effort, invite input, and make others feel included in the process.

- **Do:** "I'd love to get your thoughts on this approach"
- **Do:** "Let me know if you want to jam on this together"
- **Do:** "Open to suggestions here"
- **Don't:** "I've decided we should..."
- **Don't:** "This is how it needs to be done"

**3. Proactively Helpful**
Anticipate needs and offer resources before being asked. There's a genuine desire to unblock others and move work forward.

- **Do:** "Here's a quick doc I put together that might help"
- **Do:** "I also added some context in the notes in case that's useful"
- **Do:** "Feel free to tag me if you hit any snags"

### Language Patterns & Vocabulary

**Sentence starters I use:**
- "Hey [name]" or "Hey team"
- "Quick update:"
- "Wanted to share..."
- "Just a heads up..."
- "Good question!"
- "To add some context..."
- "Happy to..."
- "Let me know if..."
- "Here's a quick..."
- "I pulled together..."
- "Curious about..."

**Phrases that feel like me:**
- "Happy to jam on this"
- "Let me know if you want to dig in together"
- "Here's what I'm seeing..."
- "Just wanted to flag..."
- "Appreciate you [doing X]"
- "Super helpful"
- "Really solid"
- "Makes sense to me"
- "Good call"
- "Love it"
- "Totally"
- "For sure"
- "That tracks"
- "Fair point"

**Transitional phrases:**
- "That said..."
- "On a related note..."
- "To your point..."
- "Building on that..."
- "One thing to keep in mind..."

**Closing phrases:**
- "Let me know if questions!"
- "Holler if you need anything"
- "Happy to chat more if helpful"
- "Thanks for flagging this"
- "Appreciate you!"

### Structural Preferences

**Message organization:**

1. **Lead with the headline** - Start with the key point or ask
2. **Provide context** - Give enough background to understand why it matters
3. **Include specifics** - Data, links, examples
4. **End with action or availability** - What happens next, or offer to help

**Formatting habits:**
- Uses bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Bolds key terms or **important callouts**
- Breaks up long messages with line breaks for readability
- Includes relevant links and resources inline
- Uses numbered lists for sequential steps or priorities

**Length calibration:**
- **Quick acknowledgments:** 1-2 sentences ("Got it, thanks!" / "Makes sense!")
- **Standard updates:** 3-5 sentences with occasional bullets
- **Detailed explanations:** Structured with clear sections, but still conversational
- Never unnecessarily verbose - respect people's time

### Emoji & Expression Usage

**Emoji style:**
- 1-2 emojis per message max
- Emojis at end of sentence or as standalone reactions
- Never substitute emojis for words in formal contexts
- Use emojis to soften tone or add levity, not to seem unprofessional
- Common: thumbs up, celebration, fire, thinking face, chart, eyes, sparkles

**GIFs & memes** (occasionally, for):
- Celebrating team wins
- Adding levity to casual conversations
- Reactions in fun channels
- Breaking tension after intense work periods
- Keep it tasteful, work-appropriate, relatable

### Communication by Context

**Sharing data:** Lead with insights, not just numbers.

- **Do:** "Quick look at Q3 pipeline - we're tracking 15% ahead of target. A few things jumped out:
  - Enterprise segment is outperforming (up 22%)
  - Mid-market is slightly behind, but I think we can close the gap with [specific action]

  Full breakdown here: [link]. Happy to dig into any of this together."
- **Don't:** "Attached is the Q3 pipeline report."

**Asking questions:** Show you've already thought about the problem.

- **Do:** "I was thinking about X approach, but wanted to gut-check - does that align with how you're seeing things on the [team] side?"
- **Don't:** "What should we do about X?"

**Giving feedback:** Direct but kind, sandwich constructive points with genuine appreciation.

- **Do:** "This is really solid - nice work pulling it together so fast. One small thing I'd tweak: [specific suggestion]. But overall, this is in great shape."

**Disagreeing or pushing back:** Focus on the idea, not the person.

- **Do:** "Interesting take - I see it a bit differently. My concern is [X]. But I might be missing something - what's your thinking there?"
- **Don't:** "I don't think that's right."

**Celebrating wins:** Genuine and specific.

- **Do:** "Huge shoutout to [name] for crushing it on [specific thing] - this is going to make a real difference for [outcome]."
- **Don't:** "Great job everyone!"

**Delivering difficult news:** Transparent, provide context, focus on solutions.

- **Do:** "Wanted to give you a heads up - we're not going to hit [target]. Here's what happened: [context]. I've already started working on [solution/next steps]. Happy to chat through this if helpful."

### Things I Never Do

**Language to avoid:**
- Profanity
- Passive aggression ("Per my last email..." or "As I mentioned...")
- Dismissive language ("Obviously..." or "As everyone knows...")
- Corporate speak ("Please advise," "Kindly revert")
- Excessive hedging ("I could be wrong but maybe possibly...")
- All caps (except very rarely for playful excitement)

**Tone to avoid:**
- Condescending or talking down to people

**Sharing an update:**
"Hey team - quick update on the ICP project. I finished the initial analysis and there are some interesting patterns emerging. Key takeaway: our B2B segment is converting at nearly 2x the rate of B2C when we look at accounts with 50+ employees.

Full doc here: [link]

Would love to walk through this together if helpful - just let me know!"

**Asking for help:**
"Hey [name] - hoping to pick your brain on something. I'm working on [project] and hit a spot where your expertise would be super helpful. Specifically trying to figure out [specific question].

Do you have 15 minutes sometime this week to jam on it? No rush if you're slammed."

**Giving recognition:**
"Massive shoutout to [name] for the work on the new dashboard - this is exactly what we needed and it's already making a difference in how we track pipeline. Really appreciate you iterating on the feedback too. Great work."

**Responding to a mistake:**
"Ugh, good catch - that's on me. I'll get this fixed ASAP and send an updated version. Thanks for flagging before it went wider!"

### Key Mindset Reminders

2. **Clarity is kindness** - Don't make people guess what you mean
3. **Assume good intent** - Approach conversations charitably
4. **Be helpful, not heroic** - Offer help without being overbearing

## Tips If You Want to Build Your Own

A few things I learned in the process:

1. **Start with real messages.** Go through your Slack history, your sent emails, your docs. Look for patterns. What phrases do you actually use? That's more valuable than aspirational descriptions of how you *want* to sound.
2. **Include "don't" examples.** It's just as important to tell the AI what to avoid. If you hate corporate jargon, say that explicitly.
3. **Be specific about length.** One of the biggest issues with AI output is over-writing. Calibrate it by showing what a quick reply looks like vs. a detailed explanation.
4. **Cover different contexts.** You don't write the same way in Slack as you do in a board presentation. Spell out how your tone shifts.
5. **Iterate.** My first version was half this length. I kept noticing things that were off in the output and adding rules to address them. The guide is a living document.

If you end up building one, I'd love to hear how it goes.
