In SEO, most are self-taught by reading the great blogs at Moz, Blind Five Year old, Search Engine Land, etc.

That&#8217;s my story. I started on <a href="https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo" target="_blank">Moz&#8217;s SEO guide</a>Â (doesn&#8217;t it bring back good memories):

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3446" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.49.12-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-01-27 at 3.49.12 PM" width="1167" height="625" srcset="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.49.12-PM.png 1167w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.49.12-PM-300x161.png 300w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.49.12-PM-768x411.png 768w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.49.12-PM-1024x548.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1167px) 100vw, 1167px" />

I watched every Whiteboard Friday on Friday morning. I even tried to post it on Inbound before anyone else ðŸ™‚ I then graduated from only asking questions to giving answers in the forums.

Next, I started picking up content from others: Search Engine Land, SE Journal, Blind Five Year Old, SEER and hundreds of others. I followed all theÂ big names.

I thought I was an expert in SEO. I had read every article on Moz (no exxageration). I was giving expert &#8220;answers&#8221; on forums. I consulted with sites, and even completed several projectsÂ with different IT teams and Project Managers:

<a href="http://anagilemind.net/2015/02/07/collection-of-agile-related-memes/" rel="attachment wp-att-3448"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3448" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.52.33-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-01-27 at 3.52.33 PM" width="538" height="333" srcset="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.52.33-PM.png 538w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.52.33-PM-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /></a>

I &#8220;thought&#8221; I was an SEO expert. I had built the specs, run the sprints, and lived 100% organic (a little SEO / IT humor).

So a few years ago, I took my expert SEO knowledge, resume, and appliedÂ to one of the top 50 websites in the world. I landed an interview.

  * First interview was a HR screening (nailed it ).
  * Second interview was with the Director of SEO (led a team of 30). We chatted about my interest in SEO &#8211; but nothing technical.
  * Third interview was with a team member. We didn&#8217;t even talk SEO because we hit it off so well (things were looking great).
  * The final round was to analyze a competitor website and give recommendations. Easy? I got this, right? I know everything Moz, SEER, and Blind Five Year old have ever written about SEO. I wrote down my best 20 page analysis.
  * Failed it.

**It was the best thing that ever happened to me.Â **

The worst part about failing the analysis was when I asked what I could have improved, the director couldn&#8217;t tell me. I was in the dark. I didn&#8217;t know if it was because my analysis was so off that she didn&#8217;t know where to begin? Or was she afraid of giving away secrets (am I missing something crucial)?

Where was the transparency? Up until this point, everyone in SEO had been transparent: in conversations, tweets, and articles.

Not receiving an answer made me seek for answers ever more.Â What had I missed? How was I to take it to the next level? Was there another blog I was not reading? And then, it hit me:

Want to the best in SEO?Â Stop _only_ reading the mainstream blogs, start reading job descriptions of the world&#8217;s largest sites, and implement the skills they require.

**I StoppedÂ Reading _Only_ the Mainstream Blogs**

OnceÂ I got the fundamentals down, I realized that my skillset was stagnant. I knew all of the terms, had grown sites to millions in organic traffic, but needed more.

#### How many of you recognize these names?

  * <a href="http://alanbleiweiss.com/" target="_blank">Alan Bleiweiss</a>
  * <a href="http://www.rosshudgens.com/" target="_blank">Ross Hudgens</a>
  * <a href="https://twitter.com/DuaneForrester?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">Duane Forrester</a>
  * <a href="https://moz.com/rand/" target="_blank">Rand Fiskin</a>
  * <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/larry-kim" target="_blank">Larry Kim</a> (PPC)
  * <a href="http://daggle.com/" target="_blank">Danny Sullivan</a>
  * <a href="http://foundationdigital.com/greg-boser/" target="_blank">Greg Boser</a>
  * <a href="https://twitter.com/dr_pete?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">Dr. Pete</a>
  * <a href="http://cyrusshepard.com/" target="_blank">Cyrus Shepard</a>
  * <a href="https://www.portent.com/author/ian" target="_blank">Ian Lurie</a>
  * <a href="http://www.johnfdoherty.com/" target="_blank">John Doherty</a>
  * <a href="https://www.distilled.net/about/people/will-critchlow/" target="_blank">Will Critchlow</a>

These are great people (without much of their writing, I&#8217;d be deficient in my job). I could also name a hundred more that you would know. Why do we know these names? Because they publish, they are transparent about their success and failures (as much as they can be while maintaining a business advantage).

#### How many of you recognize these names?

  * <a href="http://www.jonmellen.com/" target="_blank">Jon Mellen</a>
  * <a href="http://www.stephanmack.com/" target="_blank">Stephan Mack</a>
  * <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamielcottle" target="_blank">Jamie Cottle</a>
  * <a href="http://www.kateideas.com/" target="_blank">Kaitlin McMichael</a>
  * <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterwyspianski" target="_blank">Peter Wyspianski</a>
  * <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenebates" target="_blank">Steve Bates</a>

The names above represent some of the greatest minds in SEO: Nike, TripAdvisor, Getty Images, and Amazon. For the most part (minus Kaitlin, while she worked for <a href="https://www.portent.com/" target="_blank">Portent</a>), many of the names above are non-existent on the popular blog sites.

  * Did Steve BatesÂ write an article when NikeÂ became the worlds largest shoe site? What about an article on how they used SQL + Visual mapping to make architectural changes that led to better crawling and more indexing?
  * What about Peter &#8211; when Amazon became one of the most visited sites in the world?Â Did he write an article on architectural changes that led to better crawlability, which led to more indexing, and finally: better rankings.

Of course the examples above are false, because I can&#8217;t findÂ any articles from them (and that&#8217;s okay &#8211; businesses do have to have secrets to succeed. They also probably signed non-disclosure agreements).

Better yet, TripAdvisor (one of the most respected in SEO &#8211; IMO) createdÂ [Trip Advisor SEO University](http://www.tripadvisorseo.com/)&#8230; yet it&#8217;s for employees only.

**This is not a critique in aÂ &#8220;lack of transparency&#8221; butÂ figuring out a way around it.**

If you are self-taught SEO, how do you keep learning? How do you continue to learn SEO when transparency stops?

### I Started Reading Job Descriptions

That&#8217;s right: I read job descriptions ðŸ™‚

The best companies _normally_Â don&#8217;t give away their secrets &#8211; unless it&#8217;s in a job description.

Personally, I will read a Growth / SEO job description over a blog article on &#8220;9 Billions SEO hacksÂ &#8230;&#8221; _anyday_. Why? Because you learn so much more. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You also learn what the company is focusing on (you&#8217;re basically reading the rubric to their upcoming projects).</strong></span>

Think you&#8217;re an expert? Nothing more humbling than reading a job you aren&#8217;t qualified for.Â Take a look at Trip Advisor&#8217;s JD for a SEO Strategist:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3419" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-11.54.24-AM.png" alt="SEO Technical" width="1114" height="284" srcset="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-11.54.24-AM.png 1114w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-11.54.24-AM-300x76.png 300w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-11.54.24-AM-768x196.png 768w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-11.54.24-AM-1024x261.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1114px) 100vw, 1114px" />

When was the last time you saw an in-depth post on SEO and SQL on any mainstream blogs? What about HIVE and SEO? How many SEOs know what HIVE is? (a few years ago &#8211; I didn&#8217;t). **Why? Because no one has covered it in the mainstream blogs:**

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3424" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-12.31.00-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-01-27 at 12.31.00 PM" width="739" height="457" srcset="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-12.31.00-PM.png 739w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-12.31.00-PM-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" />

How would you know that &#8220;The Best&#8221; SEOs need to know HIVE/SQL unless you read the job descriptions? Trip Advisor isn&#8217;t writing articles about &#8220;How they used HIVE in project X to grow their SEO traffic by Y%&#8221;.

Notice what is not mentioned in the JD?

**Content.** Nothing is mentioned about &#8220;Good Content&#8221;.

Let&#8217;s keep going: what about Amazon (SEO Manager):

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3420" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-12.15.34-PM.png" alt="Amazon JD" width="747" height="233" srcset="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-12.15.34-PM.png 747w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-12.15.34-PM-300x94.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" />

Geez. Still think &#8220;Good Content is the best SEO&#8221; is a good enough answer to call yourself an expert SEO? I can&#8217;t remember the last article I read on Artificial Intelligence and SEO.

### Just do it.

Reading job descriptions is humbling.

Sure, read the ones you are qualified and pat yourself on the back. But when you dig in and read the job descriptions like the ones above, you&#8217;re head will quickly start to deflate and you&#8217;ll have plenty to work on. It&#8217;s in this place you start to learn.

So what did I do after I failed? I went back &#8211; re-read the job description and quickly realized that I was no-where near qualified.Â I started thinkingÂ like:

  * &#8220;What in the world is HIVE?&#8221;
  * &#8220;How would an SEO use SQL to analyze data?&#8221;
  * &#8220;It&#8217;s notÂ illegal to crawlÂ a portion of TripAdvisor &#8211; lets get a massive list of URLs and put them in Excel and analyze them.&#8221;
  * &#8220;Oh wait&#8230; Excel crashes with that many URLs.&#8221;
  * &#8220;Ahhh&#8230; That&#8217;s why they use SQL&#8221;
  * &#8220;Let&#8217;s visualize that architecture&#8221;

It was asking those questions that led to a greater understanding of SEO. I quickly learned that large site / e-commerce SEO was less about reading the latest content or link-building piece, and more aboutÂ solving problems with large data sets. It was about:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3442" src="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.33.03-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-01-27 at 3.33.03 PM" width="1068" height="204" srcset="http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.33.03-PM.png 1068w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.33.03-PM-300x57.png 300w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.33.03-PM-768x147.png 768w, http://elioverbey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-3.33.03-PM-1024x196.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1068px) 100vw, 1068px" />

AfterÂ being declined for the job, I stopped consuming every piece of content marketing. I stayed up to date with the major publications and am grateful to those blogs for having a solid understanding of SEO, but I spentÂ my time reading job descriptions that I was not qualified for and started:

  * Learning more technicalÂ skills. I&#8217;m not going to write C, but SQL, JS &#8211; yea, I can do that.
  * Playing with large data sets and trying to find problems and patterns.
  * Started reading over robots.txt files to analyzeÂ what sites were hiding (which by the way, has led to some of the greatest discounts available! That&#8217;s where mostÂ hide their promo pages).
  * Started paying close attention to the structure of largers sites (crawlability = indexation = higher rankings).

I also started thinking about the problems they faced (and the skill-set they were seeking):

  * &#8220;Are the worried about link-building?&#8221; Probably not in the way I think of it. One link from abc.com wouldn&#8217;t move the needle.
  * &#8220;What if their bigger problem was the distribution of those backlinks among their key pages?&#8221;

It was thoughts like the above that trained my thinking to look for bigger the issues. I spent less time thinking content marketing, #SEO and more time thinking data analysis and hypothesis.

### Did it work?

A few years later, I did end up getting a job offer from a larger commerce site in SEO (in fact, one listed above).

I turned it down.

However, the skills I had acquired from reading those job descriptions led to the type of job you dream of.
